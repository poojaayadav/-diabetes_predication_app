## Diabetes Predictor

# Diabetes predication using Machine Learning module

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.


## Learning Objective

The following points were the objective of the project . If you are looking for all the following points in this repo then i have not covered all in this repo. I'm working on blog about this mini project and I'll update the link of blog about all the points in details later . (The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.)

## Data gathering

Descriptive Analysis
Data Visualizations
Data Preprocessing
Data Modelling
Model Evaluation
Model Deployment

## Technical Aspect

Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
A user has to put details like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI etc .
Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed on a new page .
