# Diabetes Predictor

# Diabetes predication using Machine Learning module

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI.
We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.


## Learning Objective

The main intention was to create an end-to-end ML project.

## Overview

This is a web app which predicts the patient has diabetes or Not.

# Project Workflow:

*  Importing Dataset
*  Basic Data exploration
*  Data Visualizations
*  Creating machine learning model
*  Model Evaluation
*  Model Deployment![Screenshot (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86607798/128338795-9bb2e112-5461-41cf-a2a6-3f516968548c.png)

*  HyperParameter Tuning

## Technical Aspect

Training a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
A user has to put details like Number of Pregnancies, Insulin Level, Age, BMI etc .
Once it get all the fields information , the prediction is displayed on a new page .
